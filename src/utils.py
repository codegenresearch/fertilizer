def url_join(*args):
    return "/".join(str(arg).strip("/") for arg in args if str(arg).strip("/"))


def flatten(arg):
    if not isinstance(arg, list):
        return [arg]
    return [x for sub in arg for x in flatten(sub)]


This code snippet addresses the `SyntaxError` by ensuring that there are no misplaced comments or text that is not valid Python code. The `url_join` function is refined to have the list comprehension directly within the `join` method call, aligning with the structure of the gold code. The `flatten` function remains unchanged as it was already correct.
